Inheritance :
    Inheritance allows a class (known as a child class or subclass) to inherit non-private properties and methods from another class (known as a parent class or superclass). 
    This facilitates code reuse and promotes a hierarchical structure in your codebase.

    Inheritance allows for polymorphism, where objects of different subclasses can be treated as objects of the same superclass, making it easier to write generic code.
