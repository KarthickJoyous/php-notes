Abstract :
    An abstract is a blueprint for other classes.
    An abstract class is a class that you can’t instantiate and can only extend by subclasses. 
    Abstract classes can have both abstract and non-abstract methods. 
    Abstract methods do not have a body and you must implement them by any subclass that extends the abstract class. 
    Non-abstract methods have a body and you can directly call them by the subclass.

When a child class is inherited from an abstract class, we have the following rules:

    - The child class method must be defined with the same name and it redeclares the parent abstract method.
    - The child class method must be defined with the same or a less restricted access modifier.
    - The number of required arguments must be the same. However, the child class may have optional arguments in addition.
