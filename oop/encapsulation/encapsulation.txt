Encapsulation : 
    Bundling (properties) and (methods) into a single unit or class.
    This unit or class controls access to the properties & methods, ensuring that it is only accessed and modified in appropriate ways.

Encapsulation is all about üëáüèª :

    Access modifiers : 

        - public
        - protected
        - private

    1.Public: Public members are accessible from outside the class. They can be accessed from anywhere, even outside of the class itself.

    2.Protected: Protected members are accessible within the class itself and by subclasses (child classes) but not from outside the class.

    3.Private: Private members are accessible only within the class itself. They cannot be accessed from outside the class or by subclasses.

Note : In a class the properties & methods can be defined with any type of access modifiers.
